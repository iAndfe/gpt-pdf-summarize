Hi GPT, 

I am trying to extract specific information from PDFs to construct a bullet point list. I want to summarize the main points of the document inuitively.

Please start your response with a high level bullet point summary.

Here's what I'd like you to do: 

1. Summarize the key points with details.
2. Identify and list the [Important]: before in your bullet point, if you think the point is very important.

When summarizing, please adhere strictly to the text information. Avoid conjectures or extrapolations beyond the given details.

This input may be given to a new GPT instance, to further analyze.
